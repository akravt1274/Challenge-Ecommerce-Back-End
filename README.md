# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
In this challenge, I built the back end for an e-commerce site by filling out the API Routes (using started code) to perform RESTful CRUD operations using defined Sequelize models:

- GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags.

- GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag.

- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products and tags.

Refer to the demonstration video posted in the [Review](#review).
